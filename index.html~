## TED: The playful wonderland behind great inventions
* Roughly 43,000 years ago, a young cave ear died in the rolling hills on the northwest border of modem day Slovenia.
* Think about that for a second, image you're a caveman, 40,000 years ago. You've master fire. You've built simple tools for hunting. You've learned how to craft garments form animal skins to keep yourself warm in the winter.
* It seems preposterous that you would invent the flute, a tool that created useless vibration in air molecules. **空气的震动**
* ancestors 祖先
* Now this turns out to be surprisingly common in the history of innovation **进步**.
* And here's the really strange things: many of those playful but seemingly frivolous inventions ended up sparking momentous transformations in science, in politics and society.
* Take what may be the most important invention of modern times: programmable computers.
* Descend from military technology, since many of the early computers were designed specifically to crack wartime codes or calculate rocket trajectories.**? What this?**
* The idea behind the flute **长笛**, of just pushing air through tubes to make a sound, was eventually modified to create the first organ **风琴**  more than 2,000 years ago.
* Now keyboards evolved from organs to clavichords **古钢琴** to harpsichords **大键琴** to the piano, until the middle of the 19th century, when a bunch of inventors finally hit on the idea of using a keyboard to trigger not sounds but letters.
* At ht height of the Islamic Renaissance, three brothers in Baghdad designed a device that was an automated **自动的** organ.
* Now , conceptually, this was a massive leap. **跳， 飞跃**
* That incredible powerful concept didn't come to us as an instrument of war or of conquest, or necessity at all. It came from the strange delight of watching a machine play music.
* The idea of programmable machines was exclusively kept alive by music for about 700 years.
* elite **精英**
* One of the most famous of those robots was, you guessed it, and automated flute player **自动的长笛演奏者** designed by a brilliant French inventor named Jacques de Vaucanson.
* fabric
* If you could program a machine to make pleasing sounds, why not program it to weave delightful patterns of color out of cloth?
*Instead of using the pins of the cylinder to represent musical notes, the would represent threads with different colors.
* loom
* Now, the cylinders were too expensive and time-consuming to make, but a half century later, another French inventor named Jacquard hit upon the brilliant idea of using paper-punched cards instead of metal cylinders. Paper turned out to be much cheaper and more flexible as a way of programming the device. 
* What really made the modern computer possible? 看一下这个的句型
* fabric **纺织物**
* There's a long list of world-changing ideas and technologies that came out of play: public museums, rubber, probability theory, the insurance business and many more.
* Necessity isn't always the mother of invention.**需求并不永远是发明的动力**
* The playful state of mind is fundamentally exploratory.
* That seeking is why so many experiences that started with simple deight and amusement eventually led us to profound breakthroughs.
* I think this has implications for how we teach kids in school and how we eccourage innovation in our workspaces, but thinking about play and delight this way also helps us detect what's comging next.
* Artificial intelligence.
* It seemed like an amusement at best, not useful in any serious way, but it turned out to be the beginning of a tech revolution that would change the world.



## Keolu Fox: Why genetic reaearch must be more diverse
* The Hawaiian leper colony surrounded by the highest sea cl in the world, and Father Damien, the Belgian missionary remaining lepers almost a 100 years after Father Damien died of leprosy.
* I remember stories she told about traveling down switchback cliff on a mule, while my uncle played her favorite hula songs on the ukulele all the way down to Kalaupapa.
* First was why a Belgian missionary chose to live in complete isolation in Kalaupapa, knowing he would inevitably contract leprosy from the community of people he sought to help.
* This got my curious about hat makes us unique as Hawaiians --namely, our genetic makeup.
* But it wasn't until high school, through the Human Genome Project, that I realized I wasn't alone in trying to connect our unique genetic ancestry to our potential health, welness and illness.
* So to me it always seemed obvious that in order to achieve this dream, we would need to sequence a diverse cohort of people to obtain the full spectrum of human genetic variation on the planet.
*
* That's why 10 years later, it continues to shock me, knowing that 96 percent of genome studies associating common genetic variation with specific diseases have focused exclusively on individuals of European ancestry.
* Now you don't need a PhD to see that leaves four percent for the rest of diversity.
* And in my own searching, I've discovered that far less than one percent have actually focused on indigenous communities, like myself.
* Just like we have different colored eyes and hair, we metabolize drugs differently based on the variation in our genomes.
* So how many of you would be shocked to learn that 95 percent of clinical trials have also exclusively featured individuals of European ancestry?
* This bias and systematic lack of engagement of indigenous people in both clinical trials and genome studies is partially the result of a history of distrust.
* For example , in 1989, researcheers from Arizona State University obtained blood samples from Arizona's Havasupai tribe, promising to alleviate the samples -- without the Havasupai's consent -- to study rates of schizophrenia, inbreeding, and challenge the Havasupai's origin story.
* This culminated in a sort of domino effect with local tribes in the Southwest -- including the Navajo Nation, one of the largest tribes in the country -- putting a moratorium on genetic. **找个时间看看他是怎么去打这个基因的官司的, 为什么能够胜诉， 莫非基因是他们部落的私有财产？胜诉之后钱咋分啊0.0**
* Now despite this history of distrust, I still believe that indigenous people can benefit from genetic research. And if we don't do something soon, the gap in health disparities is going to continue to widen.
* Hawaii, for example, has the longest life expectancy on average of any state in the US, yet native Hawaiian like myself die a full decade before our non-native counterparts, because we have some of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes **2型糖尿病**，obesity, and the number one and number two killers in the US: cardiovascular **心血管的** disease and cancer.
* So how do we ensure the populations of people that need genome sequencing the most are not the last to benefit?
* My vision is to make genetic research more native, to indigenize genome sequencing technology.
* Traditionally, genomes are sequenced in laboratories. Here's an image of you classic genome **基因图谱** sequencer. It's huge. It's the size of a refrigerator. 
* But what if you could sequence genomes on the fly? **这个地方的中文翻译有点奇怪，官方给的版本** 
* What if you fit a genome sequencer in your pocket?
* It doesn't have the same physical limitations, in that it's not tethered to a lab bench with extraneous cords, large vats of chemicals or computer monitors.
* It allows us to de-black box genome sequencing technology development in a way that's immersive and collaborative, activating and empowering indigenous communities ...as citizen scientists.
* We now have the technology to sequence leprosy bacteria in real time.
* 100 years later in Kaluapapa, we now have the technology to sequence leprosy bacteria in real time, using mobile genome sequencers, remote access to the Internet and cloud computation.
* But only if that's what Hawaiian people want. In our space, on our terms. **这个就尴尬了....**
* IndiGenomics is about science for the people by the people. We'll be starting with a tribal consultation resource, focused on educating indigenous communities on the potential use and misuse of genetic information.
* Eventually we'd like to have our own IndiGenomics research institute to conduct our ownexperiments and educate the next generation of indigenous scientists.
* And for those on the outside, ust as Father Damien did, the research community needs to immerse itself in indigenous culture or die trying.

## Anjali Tripathi: Why Earth may someday look like Mars?
* So when you look out at the stars at night, it's amazing what you can see.
* But what's more amazing is what you can't see, because what we know now is that around every star or almost every star, there's a planet, or probably a few.
* So what this picture isn't showing you are all the planets that we know about out there in space.
* But when we think about planets we tend to think of faraway things that are very different from our own.
* But there we are on a planet, and there are so many things that re amazing about Earth that we're searching far and wide to find things that are think that.
* But I want to tell you about an amazing thing here on Earth.
* And that is that every minute, 400 pounds of hydrogen and almost seven pounds of helium escape from Earth into space.
* And this is gas that is going off and never coming back.
* So hydrogen, helium and many other things make up what's known as the Earth's atmosphere.
* The atmosphere is just these gases that form a thin blue line that's seen here from the International Space Station, a photograph that some astronauts took
* And this tenuous veneer around our planet is what allows life to flourish.
* It protects our planet from too many impacts, form meteorites and the like.
* And it's such a amazing phenomenon that the fact that it's disappearing should frighten you, at least a little bit.
* So this process is something that I study and it's called atmospheric escape.
* So this process is something that I study and it's called atmospheric escape.
* So atmospheric escape is not specific to planet Earth. It's part of what it means to be a planet, if you ask me, because planets, not just here on Earth but throughout the universe, can undergo atmospheric escape.
* And the way it happens actually tells us about planets themselves.
* Because when you think about the solar system, you might think about this picture here.
* And you would say, well, there are eight planets, may be nine.
* Courtesy of New Horizons, we're including Pluto. And the ting here is , for the purposes of this talk, and atmospheric escape, Pluto is a planet in my mind, in the same way that planets around other stars that we can't see are also planets.
* So fundamental characteristics of planets include the fact that they are bodies that are bound together by gravity.
* So it's a lot of material just stuck together with this attractive force.
* That 's why they're round.
* So you can see taht gravity is really at play here.
* But another fundamental characteristic about planets is what you don't see here, and that's that's the star, the Sun, that all of the planets in the solar system are orbiting around.
* And that's fundamentally driving atmospheric escape. **讲了半天终于说重点了, 不过话说为什么是太阳的锅， 有点奇怪。**
*
